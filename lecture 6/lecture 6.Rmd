Today we're going talk about recursion and functional programming.

<h2>Warmup</h2>

<h2>Functional programming</h2>

<h3>Functions as arguments</h3>

Why is functional programming useful? Let's write a function that iterates through a list of numbers, and returns all the items that are even.

```{python}
def evens(l):
  n = []
  for e in l:
    if e%2.0==0:
      n.append(e)
  return n

nums = [1,20,3.4,11,5.7,25,11.2,22,24,10]
print evens(nums)
```

Wait, oops, we actually need all the *odd numbers*, not the even ones! What to do?

```{python}
def odds(l):
  n = []
  for e in l:
    if e%2.0!=0:
      n.append(e)
  return n
  
nums = [1,20,3.4,11,5.7,25,11.2,22,24,10]
print odds(nums)
```

Great! Later on, we realize we also need to find all the multiples of 4 in the list.

```{python}
def multiplesOfFour(l):
  n = []
  for e in l:
    if e%4.0==0:
      n.append(e)
  return n
  
nums = [1,20,3.4,11,5.7,25,11.2,22,24,10]
print multiplesOfFour(nums)
```

Gosh, it feels like we're writing the same code over and over again! What if instead, we pass that 1 line that's different to our function as an argument?

```{python}

def exclude(l,f):
  n = []
  for e in l:
    if f(e):
      n.append(e)
  return n
  
nums = [1,20,3.4,11,5.7,25,11.2,22,24,10]

def isEven(x):
  return x%2.0==0
  
def isOdd(x):
  return x%2!=0
  
print exclude(nums,isEven)
print exclude(nums,isOdd)
```

Here we've written a function, exclude( ), that takes another function as an argument. This is known as a *higher-order function*.

<h4>Anonymous functions</h4>

In addition to the function declaration style we've worked with previously, Python allows you to write anonymous functions called lambdas. Semantically, they're exactly the same: this is just a more compact syntax.

```{python}
f = lambda x : x*x
print f(5)
```

Lambdas are a convenient shorthand when you don't plan to reuse the function.

```{python}
def foo(f,x):
  if type(x)!=int:
    print "Oh no, it's not an integer!"
  else:
    print f(x)

def f(x):
  return x*x

foo(lambda x: x*x,5)
foo(f,5)
```

In the example above, both calls to foo() produce the same result, but the normal function definition way requires a few lines of code more than the lambda version. (Of course, the normal function definition way allows you to call the function later on in the code, which may be an advantage.)

<h3>Map</h3>

Python provides several functions that make it easy to work with lists in a functional programming style. 

Map( ) takes a function and a list, applies the function to each element, and returns the resulting list.

```{python}
import string

words = ["zither","Gobsmack","funicular","Vernacular","dither","damsel","Damson"]
print map(lambda x:string.lower(x),words)
```

<h3>Reduce</h3>

Reduce( ) also takes a function and a list. However, it applies the function pairwise. In the first step, it will apply the function to the first two items in the list. In all previous steps, it will apply it to the result of the previous computation and the next item in the list. It returns a single value.

In other words, it *reduces* the list down to a single value using the given function.

```{python}
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
letters = ["h","e","l","l","o","!"]
print reduce(lambda x, y: x*y, numbers)
print reduce(lambda x, y: x+y, letters)
```

<h3>Filter</h3>

Filter( ) applies a function to a list, and returns the elements of the list for which the function returns true.

It's a way of filtering out elements of a list that don't satisfy some criteria.

```{python}
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
isEven = lambda x:x%2==0
print filter(isEven,numbers)
```

(Note: % is the modulo operator in Python--- it returns the remainder of dividing the first argument by the second.)

Here we define a function that returns true if the input is even, and false otherwise. Then we apply isEven( ) to the list of numbers using filter( ), and the result is a list containing only even numbers.

<h3>Zip</h3>

Zip turns two lists into a list of tuples.

```{python}
names = ["Hermione","Luna","Pansy","Cho","Millicent","Ginny","Hannah"]
houses = ["Gryffindor","Ravenclaw","Slytherin","Ravenclaw","Slytherin","Gryffindor","Hufflepuff"]
pairs = zip(names,houses)
for p in pairs:
  print p[0], "is in", p[1]
```

Zip( ) can also be used with the * operator to unzip a list of tuples. Given a list of n-ary tuples, it returns n tuples.

You can then use list( ) to convert the tuples it returns into a list.

```{python}
pairs = [('Hermione', 'Gryffindor'), ('Luna', 'Ravenclaw'), ('Pansy', 'Slytherin'), ('Cho', 'Ravenclaw'), ('Millicent', 'Slytherin'), ('Ginny', 'Gryffindor'), ('Hannah', 'Hufflepuff')]
names,houses = zip(*pairs)
print names
print list(houses)
```

Zip is useful when you're reading items into a dictionary.

```{python}
names = ["Hermione","Luna","Pansy","Cho","Millicent","Ginny","Hannah"]
houses = ["Gryffindor","Ravenclaw","Slytherin","Ravenclaw","Slytherin","Gryffindor","Hufflepuff"]
pairs = zip(names,houses)
print dict(pairs)
```

<h3>Join</h3>

Join( ) is a string method that creates a string out of the items of an iterable (like a list).

It is technically a method on the string that is used to separate the items.

```{python}
letters = ["h","e","l","l","o","!"]
print '~'.join(letters)
```

I use it most frequently with an empty string or space character separator.

```{python}
letters = ["h","e","l","l","o","!"]
words = ["hello","world","!"]
print ''.join(letters)
print ' '.join(words)
```

<h3>Practice</h3>

Given the list below, can you write a single line of code that returns the sum of all values in the list?

```{python}
numbers = [8523, 2065, 8757, 7000, 4741, 4622, 380, 574, 5011, 220, 8281, 541, 8947, 9750, 8987, 1876, 6760, 4000, 4896, 4099, 8353, 5341, 4979, 7411, 1682, 5362, 5418, 2402, 8235, 5670, 7685, 396, 8070, 3719, 4003, 4107, 8386, 9530, 273, 1963, 2311, 6711, 9854, 4820, 1565, 2907, 9195, 6062, 3179, 9570]

<h4>Problem 2: Find the largest value in a list</h4>

Given the same list, can you write a single line of code that returns the largest value?

<h4>Problem 3: Remove False items from list</h4>

```{python}
l = [False,"penguin",1,False,True,19,20,"pepper",True,109,"a",False,"peanut","pimento",100,True,109,False]
```

<h4>Problem 4: Find all words containing a given root</h4>

Given the list of words in misc.txt, can you write a single line of code that returns a list of all elements containing the root 'present'?

```{python}
f = file('/Users/carolyn/Documents/UMass/CogMod/Ling692c/lecture 6/misc.txt','r')
print f.read().split('\n')
```

Today we'll discuss scope. We'll also practice string-processing.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(engine = 'python',engine.path="/usr/local/bin/python2")
```

<h2>Scope</h2>

So far, we haven't explicitly discussed scope. As you've probably figured out by now, variables declared within a function are bound within the scope of that function, even if they share the same name as a variable outside of the function.

```{python}
x = 3

def foo():
  x = 7

foo()
print x
```

Similarly, if you modify the value of a variable inside a function, its value outside the function will not be affected.

```{python}
x = 3

def foo(y):
  y = y+7  #We could return y and update x with the result of foo(x) in order to affect the value of x in the outer context.

foo(x)
print x
```

However, more care must be taken with mutable datatypes. Datatypes like lists have methods that modify the list in place. It's important to be aware that the calling these methods inside a function will affect the value of the datatype outside the function as well.

```{python}
l = ["b","z","a"]

def foo(s):
  s.sort()

foo(l)
print l
```

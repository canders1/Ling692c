Today we'll go over Python's atomic types and basic data structures.

<h3>Getting started</h3>

In this class, we're using Python 2.7. 

If you haven't already installed it, you should go to https://www.python.org/downloads and do so now.

You can write Python and run it using the Python IDLE, but to write programs and save them, you'll need to use a text editor.

I use Sublime Text, which is free and multi-purpose.

<h3>Language properties</h3>

Python is intepreted and dynamically typed (like R!)

<h3>Data Types</h3>

<h4>Integers</h4>

```{python}
x = 10
print(x)
print(type(x))
```

<h4>Floats</h4>

Python has another numeric datatype, which is used for floating point numbers.

```{python}
y = 5.0
print(y)
print(type(y))
```

<h4>Integer and Double Operations</h4>

<h6>Arithmetic operations</h6>

When you divide a float by a float, you get a float.

```{python}
y = 21.0
x = 5.0
z = y/x
print(z)
print(type(z))
```

When you divide an integer by an integer, you get an integer.

```{python}
y = 21
x = 5
z = y/x
print(z)
print(type(z))
```

However, converting an integer to a float is very easy.

<h6>Type conversion</h6>

```{python}
x = 5
y = float(x)
print(type(y))
```

<h4>Booleans</h4>

```{python}
x = True
y = False
print(x,y)
```

<h4>Boolean operations</h4>

<h6>Equality testing</h6>

```{python}
x = True
y = False
print(x == y)
```

<h6>Negation</h6>

```{python}
x = True
y = False
print(x != y)
print(not (x == y))
print((not x) == y)
```

<h6>Conjunction and Disjunction</h6>

```{python}
print((True or False) == True)
print((True and False) == True)
```

<h4>Comparing numeric types</h4>

```{python}
i = 5
j = 5.0
print(j == i)
print(j > i)
print(j <= i)
```

<h4>Strings</h4>

Python is great for string-processing!

```{python}
cat = "Captain Haddock"
print(cat)
```

Often, we want to know the length of the string we're dealing with.

```{python}
print(len("cat"))
```
One helpful feature is being able to slice strings.

*Important note*: Unlike R, Python indexes starting at 0.

```{python}
yummy = "marshmallow"
gummy = yummy[0:5]
print(gummy)
```

Another common task is finding substrings.

```{python}
yummy = "marshmallow"
gummy = "marsh"
print(gummy in yummy)
```

We can also build up longer strings through concatenation.

```{python}
fish = "Haddock"
title = "Captain"
cat = title+" "+fish
print(cat)
```

We can divide a string by a specified character using split.

```{python}
cat = "Captain Haddock"
print(cat.split(" "))
```

The object returned by split() is a list of strings.

<h4>Lists</h4>

Python lists can hold heterogenous data types.

```{python}
cat_data = [5,"Captain Haddock","Calvin",11,True]
print(cat_data)
print(type(cat_data[0]))
```

Notice that the contents of a list can be indexed just like strings. We can also take slices of lists.

```{python}
cat_data = [5,"Captain Haddock","Calvin",11,True]
cats = cat_data[1:3]
print(cats)
```

There are all kinds of useful list operations. But the most important to know for now is how to add new items.

```{python}
cats = ["Captain Haddock","Calvin"]
cats.append("Jane")
print(cats)
```

We can also remove items.

```{python}
cats = ["Captain Haddock","Calvin","Jane"]
cats.remove("Jane")
print(cats)
```

Notice that we did not have to save the result of append() or remove() as a list. These methods do not return anything; they update the list in place.

There is also a built-in sort method for lists, which likewise sorts in place.

```{python}
cats = ["Captain Haddock","Smurfie","Calvin","Jane"]
cats.sort()
print(cats)
```

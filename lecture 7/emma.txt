and
if
she
were
to
take
any
pains
to
marry
him
she
would
probably
repent
it
six
years
hence
if
he
could
meet
with
a
good
sort
of
young
woman
in
the
same
rank
as
his
own
with
a
little
money
it
might
be
very
desirable
six
years
hence
dear
miss
woodhouse
he
would
be
thirty
years
old
well
and
that
is
as
early
as
most
men
can
afford
to
marry
who
are
not
born
to
an
independence
mr
martin
i
imagine
has
his
fortune
entirely
to
make
cannot
be
at
all
beforehand
with
the
world
whatever
money
he
might
come
into
when
his
father
died
whatever
his
share
of
the
family
property
it
is
i
dare
say
all
afloat
all
employed
in
his
stock
and
so
forth
and
though
with
diligence
and
good
luck
he
may
be
rich
in
time
it
is
next
to
impossible
that
he
should
have
realised
any
thing
yet
to
be
sure
so
it
is
but
they
live
very
comfortably
they
have
no
indoors
man
else
they
do
not
want
for
any
thing
and
mrs
martin
talks
of
taking
a
boy
another
year
i
wish
you
may
not
get
into
a
scrape
harriet
whenever
he
does
marry
i
mean
as
to
being
acquainted
with
his
wife
for
though
his
sisters
from
a
superior
education
are
not
to
be
altogether
objected
to
it
does
not
follow
that
he
might
marry
any
body
at
all
fit
for
you
to
notice
the
misfortune
of
your
birth
ought
to
make
you
particularly
careful
as
to
your
associates
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
your
being
a
gentleman
s
daughter
and
you
must
support
your
claim
to
that
station
by
every
thing
within
your
own
power
or
there
will
be
plenty
of
people
who
would
take
pleasure
in
degrading
you
yes
to
be
sure
i
suppose
there
are
but
while
i
visit
at
hartfield
and
you
are
so
kind
to
me
miss
woodhouse
i
am
not
afraid
of
what
any
body
can
do
you
understand
the
force
of
influence
pretty
well
harriet
but
i
would
have
you
so
firmly
established
in
good
society
as
to
be
independent
even
of
hartfield
and
miss
woodhouse
i
want
to
see
you
permanently
well
connected
and
to
that
end
it
will
be
advisable
to
have
as
few
odd
acquaintance
as
may
be
and
therefore
i
say
that
if
you
should
still
be
in
this
country
when
mr
martin
marries
i
wish
you
may
not
be
drawn
in
by
your
intimacy
with
the
sisters
to
be
acquainted
with
the
wife
who
will
probably
be
some
mere
farmer
s
daughter
without
education
to
be
sure
yes
not
that
i
think
mr
martin
would
ever
marry
any
body
but
what
had
had
some
education
and
been
very
well
brought
up
however
i
do
not
mean
to
set
up
my
opinion
against
your
s
and
i
am
sure
i
shall
not
wish
for
the
acquaintance
of
his
wife
i
shall
always
have
a
great
regard
for
the
miss

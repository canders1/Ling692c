Today we're going to talk about data visualization and exporting data. Much of this lecture is borrowed from a data processing tutorial put together by Dan Saunders (https://github.com/gridclub/PythonPandasTutorial).

<h2>Data Processing</h2>

One useful library for data manipulation and processing in Python is pandas. Among other features, pandas provides a dataframe data structure that will be familiar to R folks.


<h2>Data Visualization</h2>

<h2>Exporting Data</h2>

<h2>Bonus: Calling R from Python</h2>

You can use the rpy2 library to run R directly from Python.

No one who had ever seen Catherine Morland in her infancy would have supposed her born to be an heroine.
From Pope, she learnt to censure those who bear about the mockery of woe.
From Gray, that Many a flower is born to blush unseen, And waste its fragrance on the desert air.
And from Shakespeare she gained a great store of information-amongst the rest, that- Trifles light as air, Are, to the jealous, confirmation strong, As proofs of Holy Writ.
The Morlands lived in a village in Wiltshire.
Mr. and Mrs. Morland were all compliance.
In addition to what has been already said of Catherine Morland's personal and mental endowments, it may be stated, that her heart was affectionate.
Sally must from situation be at this time the intimate friend and confidante of her sister.
It is remarkable, however, that she neither insisted on Catherine's writing by every post, nor exacted her promise of transmitting the character of every new acquaintance, nor a detail of every interesting conversation that Bath might produce.
Everything indeed relative to this important journey was done, on the part of the Morlands, with a degree of moderation and composure, which seemed rather consistent with the common feelings of common life.
With more than usual eagerness did she hasten to the pump-room the next day, secure within herself of seeing Mr. Tilney there before the morning were over, and ready to meet him with a smile.
This question answered, as it readily was, the stranger pronounced hers to be Thorpe.
Mrs. Allen immediately recognized the features of a former schoolfellow and intimate, whom she had seen only once since their respective marriages, and that many years ago.
Mrs. Thorpe, however, had one great advantage as a talker, in a family of children.
John was at Oxford.
And William was at sea.
She was forced to sit and appear to listen to all these maternal effusions, consoling herself that the lace on Mrs. Thorpe's pelisse was not half so handsome as that on her own.
I told Captain Hunt at one of our assemblies this winter that if he was to tease me all night, I would not dance with him.
He would allow Miss Andrews to be as beautiful as an angel.
Sir Charles Grandison!
It was decided that the gentlemen should accompany them to Edgar's Buildings, and pay their respects to Mrs. Thorpe.
James and Isabella led the way; and so well satisfied was the latter with her lot, so contentedly was she endeavouring to ensure a pleasant walk to him who brought the double recommendation of being her brother's friend, that, though they overtook and passed the two offending young men in Milsom Street, she was so far from seeking to attract their notice, that she looked back at them only three times.
John Thorpe kept of course with her.
You will find, however, Miss Morland, it would be reckoned a cheap thing by some people, for I might have sold it for ten guineas more the next day.
Jackson, of Oriel, bid me sixty at once.
Morland was with me at the time.
This critique, the justness of which was unfortunately lost on poor Catherine, brought them to the door.
The feelings of the discerning and unprejudiced reader of Camilla gave way to the feelings of the dutiful and affectionate son.
My dear Eleanor, the riot is only in your own brain.
The confusion there is scandalous.
Miss Morland has been talking of nothing more dreadful than a new publication which is shortly to come out, in three duodecimo volumes, two hundred and seventy-six pages in each, with a frontispiece to the first, of two tombstones and a lantern-do you understand?
And you, Miss Morland-my stupid sister has mistaken all your clearest expressions.
You talked of expected horrors in London-and she immediately pictured to herself a mob of three thousand men assembling in St. George's Fields, the Bank attacked, the Tower threatened, the streets of London flowing with blood, a detachment of the Twelfth Light Dragoons (the hopes of the nation) called up from Northampton to quell the insurgents, and the gallant Captain Frederick Tilney, in the moment of charging at the head of his troop, knocked off his horse by a brickbat from an upper window.
Miss Eliza Bennet, said she, despises cards.
I deserve neither such praise nor such censure, cried Elizabeth; I am not a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.
In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure, said Bingley; and I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her quite well.
Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley.
She had known the late Mr. Darcy by character perfectly well.
In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute description which Wickham could give, and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor, she was delighting both him and herself.
On being made acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy's treatment of him, she tried to remember some of that gentleman's reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it.
She was confident at last that she recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.
There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them.
Mr. Darcy had brought with him the younger son of his uncle.
He had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle.
He had brought with him the younger son of his uncle, Lord --.
To the great surprise of all the party, when Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him.
Charlotte had seen them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect.
I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility.
Mr. Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me.
Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment, before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room.
Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman.
Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire-paid his compliments, with his usual reserve.
He paid his compliments to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her friend, met her with every appearance of composure.
Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying a word.
Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners were very much admired at the Parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings.
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was a welcome relief to him at Rosings.
Mrs. Collins's pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much.
He now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before.
She had never been half so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself.
I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will never play really well unless she practises more.
Though Mrs. Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to Rosings every day.
She may play on the pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinson's room.
FITZWILLIAM DARCY
Good God! what is the matter? cried he, with more feeling than politeness; then recollecting himself, I will not detain you a minute; but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner.
You are not well enough; you cannot go yourself.
Dearest Lizzy, Imprudent as the marriage would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland.
Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland.
Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day before.
Lydia's short letter gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green.
Her short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green.
Something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that she never intended to go there.
Something was dropped to Mrs. F. expressing his belief that he never intended to go there.
He never intended to marry Lydia at all.
Something was dropped to him, which was repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B. intending to trace their route.
He did trace them easily to Clapham, but no further; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom.
After making every possible inquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire.
With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn.
I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F., but no one can throw any blame on them.
Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great.
MY DEAR HARRIET, I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I love, and he is an angel.
You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater, when I write to them and sign my name 'Lydia Wickham.'
Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to-night.
I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown.
Give my love to Colonel Forster.
Your affectionate friend, LYDIA BENNET.
Mary and Kitty have been very kind.
Kitty is slight and delicate.
Mary studies so much.
My aunt Phillips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, she was of great use and comfort to us all.
And Lady Lucas has been very kind.
MY DEAR BROTHER, I have seen them both- Then it is as I always hoped, cried Jane; they are married!
Elizabeth read on: I have seen them both.
They are not married, nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will not be long before they are.
You will easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham's circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be.
Yours, etc., EDW. GARDINER.
At such a moment, the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought.
When she saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband, she cringed; he bore it, however, with admirable calmness.
He could even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St. James's, with very decent composure.
If he did shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.

Today we're going to work some more with strings. We'll also learn about regular expressions.

#WARMUP EXERCISE

<h3>Regular expressions</h3>

Regular expressions are all about pattern-matching. They are called *regular expressions* because the basic atomics and operations form a *regular language*. However, regular expressions in many languages, including Python, have expanded functionality so that they are no longer regular.

<h4>Regular expression syntax</h5>

<h5>Character classes</h5>

. : any character except newline

\\w : word

\\d : digit

\\s : whitespace

\\t : tab

\\n : newline

<h5>Quantifiers</h5>

\* : 0 or more

\+ : 1 or more

? : 0 or 1

<h5>Anchors</h5>

\^ : start of string

\$ : end of string

<h5>Sets</h5>

[ ] : set

[^ ] : complement of set

\| : or

[ - ] : range
